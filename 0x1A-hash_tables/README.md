This is the readme file for the project 0x1A-hash_tables, which focuses on hash tables. This project will help give a more understanding to dictionaries in Python as they use this concept, a technique where keys are mapped to their values using the hash function. In short, a hash table can be said to be an array of structs, which are key/value pairs. In this project i will-:

0. Write a function that creates a hash table
1. Write a hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm.
2. Write a function that gives you the index of a key.
3. Write a function that adds an element to the hash table.
4. Write a function that retrieves a value associated with a key.
5. Write a function that prints a hash table.
6. Write a function that deletes a hash table.
7. Rewrite the previous functions using the provided data structures
